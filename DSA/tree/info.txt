Binary Tree :
    -> Each node having at most 2 child nodes and atleast 0 child
    - Types :
        - Strict Binary Tree : when a tree has either 2 child nodes or 0.
        - Complete Binary Tree : when a tree has all the levels filled from left to right.


Tree Trversal :
    -> Inorder : Left -> Root -> Right
    -> Preorder : Root -> Left ->  Right
    -> Postorder : Left -> Right -> Root


    Binary Search Tree :
        -> Values less than root goes to the left and value greater than root goes to right.



    AVL Tree :
        -> It is a self balanced tree , which was invented by Adelson Velsisi and Landis to overcome the time complexity of bst.
